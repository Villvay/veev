# Veev
#### Lightweight php framework for rapid web weaving

*This is the 2015 version of the TinyFx php framework.*

This version comes with:
- Self and Minimal Configuration
- Improved schema based table and form builder
- Advanced form inputs such as Currency, Numeric, Richtext, File, Folder, Autocomplete etc..
- TinyMCE and FontAwsome integrated BoilerPlate templates
- Example App with User Management and Blogging

This version is not compatible with the previous version.
This version implements a new modular design pattern.
This is NOT an MVC framework. This is much easier to work with.
This is a completely different perspective
There are modules, interfaces and templates.


## Instructions - Getting Started
1. Check-out this repo to a folder under var/www/html or htdocs
2. Start Apache or WAMP
3. Create database from the provided database.sql
4. Make sure apache can write in to the directory (or you will have to manually copy the .htaccess and framework/config.php)
5. Navigate to http://localhost/veev or wherever the folder you checked this out.
6. Provide database username/password, and modify default settings as needed.
7. configure.php will generate .hraccess and framework/config.php

- Your database settings are now in framework/config.php
- N.B: If you rename or move the project folder, you will need configure.php; delete .htaccess and framework.php to reconfigure.
Do the same when deployed to staging or production server. On production server, delete the configure.php once configured.

- Navigate to http://localhost/veev/admin Username:admin , Password:admin


## Module
A module is a section of a website, like Admin section, Dashboard, Shopping cart, Blog etc..
All contents of each of these modules is put inside a single folder. There is a module controller for every module.
There can be many functions in a module controller, and a view file corresponding to each of these functions.
An HTTP request will load a module, execute a function and render the view.


## Development
In the example app, you will find three modules: index, user and admin.
The module controller file name starts with an '@' and ends with the extension '.module.php'.
All the other files are views, if not starting with an underscore (_), in which case those are shared view partials.

Format: http://example.com/module/method/parameter/s

Eg: http://example.com/user/log-in/
- This http request will first load the module ~/modules/user/@user.module.php
- Then invoke the function log_in($params)
- If this was a POST request (user clicked "Log In" - submit), post fields (username/password) will be put in to $params


You can put a module inside a module, then it become a sub-module.

http://example.com/module/submodule/method/parameter/s

Eg: http://example.com/admin/users/edit/8
- This http request will load the module ~/modules/admin/users/@users.module.php
- Then invoke the function log_in($params) - **NOTICE the dash is converted to an underscore**
- Since this is a GET request, $params[0] will be 8


To move a website section into another master section, all you need to do is to move a single folder into another. (and edit any urls as necessory)

Also, you can copy a module from one project to another. On a Linux server, you can create a SymLink to share a module between two websites.


## URLs
We recommend using absolute URLs *Whenever Not Impossible*
You can use **BASE_URL** and **BASE_URL_STATIC** to refer to website root url.
Eg:

```php
<a href="<?= BASE_URL; ?>dashboard">Dashboard</a>

<img src="<?= BASE_URL_STATIC; ?>images/flower.jpg" />

<script src="<?= BASE_URL_STATIC; ?>js/script.js"></script>

```

**BASE_URL_STATIC** is defined in framework/config.php
You may later want to leverage static content to a cookieless subdomain.
If you use **BASE_URL_STATIC**, you only need to change this in one place.
Also, for uploading files to this static directory, use **STATIC_FILES_ROOT**.
This is the relative path from website root to static content path.


## How a request is processed
Just like the old TinyF(x), on HTTP requests, related module is loaded and the related method in the module is invoked.
The invoked method receives an array of HTTP parameters. It should return an associative array,
which will be converted to variables for the view. When the method returns, the related view is rendered,
then put in to the template as defined on the top of the module.

To help in processing the HTTP requests in modules, you can use various interfaces such as:
Database, ImageMagic, EMail, GCM etc..

To help in rendering HTML in views, there is a library of helper methods such as:
render_data_view, render_form, render_table, flash_message, render_dropdown, shorten_string, slugify, beautify_datetime

These are pretty self explainatory. You can look up all these on framework/render.php


## Database
To connect to the database from the module, all you need to call is:
```php
$db = connect_database();
```

This will connect to the database as defined in framework/config.php
If the primary key of a table is 'id' and set to auto_increment, this database abstraction object makes things like Insert, Update and Delete much easy.

For an example:
```php
// This could be a submitted form ($_POST becomes $params)
// $params = array('title' => 'Lorem ipsum', 'content' => 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit ...');
$db->insert('blog', $params);
//	INSERT INTO `blog`(`title`, `content`) VALUES('Lorem ipsum', 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit ...')

// $params = array('id' => 4, 'password' => '86f7as54dfg8769...');
$db->update('user', $params);
//	UPDATE `user` SET `password` = '86f7as54dfg8769...' WHERE id = 4

$db->delete('blog', $params[0]);	//	$params[0] = 6 (from GET parameter 1 - http://example.com/admin/delete-blog-post/8)
//	DELETE FROM `blog` WHERE id = 6

```


## View Helpers
**Unleash the full potential of Rocket-Fuelled Paper-Planes.!**
*Treacle for CURD*

For the first three data related view helpers you need to define data schema as follows:
This is like a 'model' in conventional php frameworks, but much simpler.
Veev abstracts the rest for you inteligently and intuitively.

Of course you can define these in a seperate folder and include in module controller,
but why not define them in module controller itself..

```php
$pages_schema = array(
				'stub' 		=> array('Title', 		'key' => true),
				'en' 		=> array('English', 	'display' => 'richtext', 'table' => false),
				'ch' 		=> array('Chinese', 	'display' => 'richtext', 'table' => false),
				'slides' 	=> array('Slides', 		'display' => 'folder', 'path' => 'user/images/uploads/{stub}', 'table' => false),
				'edit' 		=> array('Edit', 		'form' => false, 'cmd' => 'admin/pages/{key}', 'default' => true),
				'view' 		=> array('View', 		'form' => false, 'cmd' => '{key}')
			);

```

#### key
This is to tell that this field is the primary key. When a form is generated, this will be a hidden field.

#### table
If this is set to false, this field will not be displayed on the table, but only on form, and data view.

#### display
Valid values are:
enum, autofill, calendar, calendar+clock, password, textarea, richtext, email, currency, numeric, check, checkbox, file, folder.

##### enum
Renders a select (drop-down) on form, and maps a value in database to a more descriptive string for table and data view.

##### autofil
Similar to enum, but renders an auto complete textbox on form.

##### calendar
On the form, renders a calendar controller to select a date.

##### password
An input with type="password"

##### textarea
A textarea inout that softly resizes to contain text content


### render_table

On the module:
```php
global $pages_schema;
$data = array();
$db = connect_database();

$data['schema'] = $pages_schema;
$data['pages'] = $db->select(
				array('stub', 'en', 'ch'),
				'content');
		//	SELECT stub, en, ch FROM content
return $data;
```

On the view:
```php
render_table($schema, $pages, 'tbl-pages');
```
This will generate a nice table to display the records.
You can use the static/css/datatable.css for a fine visual style compatible with this.


### render_form

On the module:
```php
global $pages_schema;
$data = array();
$db = connect_database();

$data['schema'] = $pages_schema;
$data['page'] = mysql_fetch_assoc(
				$db->select(
					array('stub', 'en', 'ch'),
					'content', 'stub = \''.$params[0].'\''));
		//	SELECT stub, en, ch FROM content WHERE stub = 'home'
return $data;
```

On the view:
```php
render_form($schema, $page, 'admin/save-page');
```

That should work for editing an existing record.
For adding a new record, you need to make $page = array(/with empty values/);


### render_data_view
This is very similar to render_form, but read-only.


### flash_message
On the templates/home.php you can find <?php flash_message_dump(); ?> line.
From the module or view, you can put a flash message to be displayed there (on top of the page, right under the masthead.

To put a message there, call this function:
```php
flash_message('Blog post saved', 'success');

flash_message('Wrong Username or Password', 'error');

flash_message('You don't have permission to edit this', 'warning');

```


### render_dropdown
### shorten_string
### slugify
### beautify_datetime
